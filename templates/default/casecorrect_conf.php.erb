# CaseCorrection handles mistakes of case in PmWiki addresses (eg. homepage 
# instead of HomePage) by looking for a case-insensitive match in all of a 
# wiki's pages. If a match is found, the user is silently redirected to it. 

# There should be a '(:case-correction:)' line in Site.PageNotFound.
